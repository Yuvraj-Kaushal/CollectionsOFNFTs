# NFT Marketplace

* I have used solidity and other dependencies like Hardhat, Alchemy, Pinata, React and Ethers.js to build this app.

* I've Also used openzepellin libraryâ€™s ERC721 smart contract to create my own NFT smart contract.

* To deploy the smart contract I have used ethers.js.

* For the frontend I have used react, for now I have listed only 5 NFTs, a user would be able to connect to their metamask and mint any 2 of these NFTs.

* After minting, you can see your NFT in your own metamask wallet.
